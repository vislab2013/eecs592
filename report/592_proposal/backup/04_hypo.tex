\section{Generate and Evaluate Layout Hypotheses}
\label{sec:4}

Our initial plan for generating and evaluating candidate layouts is to follow the method described in \cite{Hedau_ICCV2009}. However, given the rich 3D scene information we obtain from vanishing point estimation, we can further refine the layout estimation which only relies on 2D features. We plan to combine the learned layout model in \cite{Hedau_ICCV2009} and our scene information $S$ to re-rank the candidate layouts, and obtain the final result.
